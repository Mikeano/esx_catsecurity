All the credits for this resource go to Cr1MsOn for the base of this amazing script!
This resource as you have read from the title is a Security Job! You are probably wondering what it is and what kind of Roleplay could someone do with this Job! 
Someone who is using this job could also make some kind of agreement through Roleplay to protect a shop etc! Also, it can craft bulletproof vest 
and make some sort of exchange....
